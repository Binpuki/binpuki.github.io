# Welcome!
Apologies there's not much here at the moment. I can tell you a little about myself though!
# About me
Call me Violet! A woman who's main hobby is programming. I got experience in mainly game development with Godot and Unity, but I have created applications in the past too.

I mainly work with .NET and C#, but I do have experience in Haxe, Java, GML, and GDScript as well. I have minimal experience in Python and C++.
# Works
Things I've worked on so far (that I'm proud to showcase) are:
- [hxWebP](https://github.com/Binpuki/hxWebP)
- [HoloFunk](https://gamejolt.com/games/holofunk/754195)
- [LazuNight Funkin'](https://gamejolt.com/games/lazunight/723472)
